## Details
Contains one static class "MazeGen2" that returns an 2D array of your maze size (columns and rows).
Each node in the array contains WallStatus flags to indicate which of its four walls are enabled.

## Notes
The WPF Canvas element draws the maze flipped horizontally 'cause its 0,0 is at the bottom left.
